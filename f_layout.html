        <p>
            Ethernet is a  wired computer networking technology commonly used in Lan, man and wide area networks.
            Ethernet was created within the year 1973 by a team at the Xerox Corporation's town centre (Xerox PARC) in CA. The team, crystal rectifiers by Yankee applied scientist Henry M. Robert Metcalfe, sought-after to make a technology that would connect several computers over long distances.
            Robert Metcalfe:(Robert  Melancton Metcalfe , is associate engineer and entrepreneur from the u.  s. WHO helped pioneer the web beginning in 1970. He co-invented Ethernet)

        <li>SWITCHING SYSTEMS:</li>
        <p>SWITCHING SYSTEMS:
            A Switching system is a control of elements and connecting the devices there are at distinct points  switching systems reduced the complexity of wiring and made the telephony hassle-free.
            Inventor of switching systems :
            Paul Baran : Who was a pioneer in the development of computer networks.
            But during the war some of the connection was lost so they used different ways to transfer the data by the concept of mouse with maze If some connection is lost the data transfer will fail so they introduced nodes act as a traffic controller for the path The packets from one computer is Sended to the nodes and the nodes will copy the packet data and allow a path to reach the destination, if something happens and the packets are missed then again the nodes will send the missing packets to the destination.  This is better than a telephone.

            In 1962 The first mentions of the internet took place, a researcher named J.C.R.  Licklider( MIT) discussed his Galactic Network concept in a series of notes.
            4 identical networks were established

        <li>Lawrence G. Roberts and ARPANET</li>
        <p>
            ARPANET was pushed forward by AN MIT investigator named Lawrence G. Roberts, United Nations agency was one amongst the 3 researchers United Nations agency had originally worked on Klein rock’s network in 1965. Additional computers' area unit additional : several computers' area unit additional to ARPANET. Whereas computers were being additional, researchers additionally wanted to boost communications technologies. Researchers were laborious at work developing host-to-host protocol, as an example, additionally known as Network management Protocol. By 1971 and 1972, NCP was prepared for implementation. That meant network users may finally develop their own applications to be used across the network.
            BBN:The web became BBN's chief focus. Employed by AN calculable twenty million folks in mid-1994, this method, originally chiefly for noncommercial communications amongst teachers and researchers, was a natural outgrowth of ARPANET, the military communications system BBN had devised as a precursor of the web. BBN had, in 1993, non inheritable  Nearnet, the geographic region web services supplier, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The subsequent year it purchased  BARNET , the most important web access supplier within the point of entry space, from Stanford. Before the top of 1994 BBN additionally non inheritable SURANEt, the leading web access supplier within the Southeast, delivered the quantity of its web customers to quite one,100 and created it the most important supplier of web access and security services to firms and establishments.
            In July 1995 AT&T firm. Bought a minority share of BBN Planet, shortly once closing a partnership agreement whereby BBN Planet would supply a broad array of web services to AT&T purchasers. BBN therefore became one amongst the nation's "backbone" web service suppliers, like IBM world Network, MCI, and Sprint. Per se it absolutely was in operation trunk phone lines connecting major regions of the US and closely-held major regional laptop networks that hold on and send information for its purchasers. The dealings additionally gave BBN access to AT&T's fiber-optic network. A Gregorian calendar month 1996 report by a Cambridge analysis firm concluded that BBN/AT&T provided the "best security, soup-to-nuts management, and leading concepts for personal and warranted period of time Internets

            Web is used part of daily life
            First browser is www(world web wide) (mark)it is only seen in web
            Second web browser : internet explorer, the second most popular web browser. Sometime in late 1998 or early 1999, it is aMicrosoft's corporation and  became the most popular web browser, beating out Netscape.
            Netscape is a one of the web browser
            13th October 1994 after trying non-stop coding netscape launched a web browser and navigator and used by lots of users.gate way for millions of people
            At that time Microsoft trying to work hard and trying to beat netscape
            The internet bubble was an exchange bubble caused by excessive speculation of the inter-related corporations within the late Nineties, a amount of huge growth with the use and adoption of the net.
            Rob mc cool(founder of netscape), jim clark (co-founder of netscape) Aleks Totic (founding engineer )
            When internet explorer is introduced 90 percent of pc are changed their web browser to internet explorer and Microsoft earned billions of dollars
